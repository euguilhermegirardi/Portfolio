               My background is in Civil Engineering, yet I switched to the
               field of IT, after seven years of experience in the constructor
               sector. At first, my focus was on improving my skills in HTML,
               CSS, and JavaScript but, currently, I am studying ReactJS,
               Node.js, and React Native. Besides, I am working on personal
               projects to show the knowledge I have acquired along this
               journey. I am a positive, open-minded, and fast learner person. I
               am giving it my all since I left a career behind, and found in IT
               my passion. It makes me happy that every day I feel motivated to
               learn something new to add to my projects.
